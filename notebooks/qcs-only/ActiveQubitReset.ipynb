    "Before running on the QPU, users must book a block of time on a lattice using the QCS command-line interface. To determine the lattices that are available for booking, you can run `qcs lattices` from within the QMI. For our [Aspen QPUs](https://www.rigetti.com/qpu), one of the currently available 8-qubit lattices is `Aspen-1-8Q-B`. Once your QPU time has started (which we call being \"QPU-engaged\"), you must then set up the `QuantumComputer` object associated with the booked lattice, which we do in the following cell.\n",
